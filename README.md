# benchRP  -  Results Parser for SETI MB Benchmark Tools

 Utility to read MB_bench_213 results file and output a pipe delimited file for import into excel

 Plan to modify so that it can parse arguments from the psv file output by benchMT to produce a
 parseable file with argument names as column headers and argument values as row items.  This is
especially useful for profiling results of GPU app DOE results.
